1. Two Sum

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to_ `target`.

You may assume that each input would have _exactly one solution_, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

*Test Case 1:*
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```
*Test Case 2:*
```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```
*Test Case 3:*
```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

2. Add Two Numbers

You are given two *non-empty* linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in *reverse order*, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

*Test Case 1:*
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```
*Test Case 2:*
```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```
*Test Case 3:*
```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```
